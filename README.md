# I created this from the concept of the internet of medical things. 
# The idea is mainly for older adults that might forget about their medication and when to take it. It is designed to be simple and easy to use.
#If the manufacturer and track that the buyer is really using the medicine, or if there is a possible worst case scenario and somebody becomes ill or so from the medicine, it can be traced back to the source. It can verify that they are taking the medication as needed and when to refill.
